# Project: NYC Open Data
### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

Our dataset is downloaded from the NY open data. Due to the large volumes of our data, it's saved in a zip file.
